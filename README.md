🌱 AGRI-CONNECT

AGRI-CONNECT is a hackathon project built under UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger.
The platform empowers farmers with insights on suitable crops to grow based on their location, soil type, season, and weather patterns. It also creates a food distribution network by connecting people with surplus food to those in need, ensuring reduced waste and better food accessibility.
